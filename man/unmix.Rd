\title{Unmixing a distribution by decomposing it in two normal ones with unequal means and variances.}
\usage{
unmix(x, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector of discriminant scores with optional attribute "classnames", e.g. c("female","male")}

\item{verbose}{logical (default = FALSE)}
}
\value{
A list consisting of
\itemize{
\item\code{cutpoint} point of equal density of the normal distributions
\item\code{p1} estimated probability of class 0 ("female"), informally: fraction of individuals in class 0
\item\code{p2} estimated probability of class 1 ("female"), informally: fraction of individuals in class 0
\item\code{m1} estimated mean of the normal distribution of class 0
\item\code{m2} estimated mean of the normal distribution of class 1
\item\code{v1} estimated variance of the normal distribution of class 0
\item\code{v2} estimated variance of the normal distribution of class 1
}

\description{
\code{unmix} generates a cutpoint below which individuals are predicted to be female
(level 1 of \code{factor(sex)}) and above which they are predicted to be
male (level 2 of \code{factor(sex)}). The cutpoint is at the point of intersection of two normal densities with unequal
means and variances fitted to argument \code{x}. This function is used internally in the \code{\link{predict.gendis}} function.
}
\details{
\code{unmix} is an EM algorithm following example 4.3.2 of Titterington et al. (1985). Alternatively,
library \code{flexmix} could have been used.

\examples{
data("fulmarin")
result <- gendis(population = "population", sex = "sex",
                 measurements = "other_variables", verbose = FALSE ,  data=fulmarin )
data("JanMayenBirds")
GDFscores <- predict(result, newdata = JanMayenBirds, type = "GDF")
attr(GDFscores, which = "cutpoint") <- NULL # remove the cutpoint
str(GDFscores)
# note the attribute classnames with the names to be used
# for first and second level of the factor sex
# recalculate the cutpoint using unmix instead of predict.gendis
unmix(GDFscores,verbose = TRUE)
